Otter is a lightweight and user-friendly API testing tool developed in Golang. It enables users to define testing
scenarios with multiple API calls and validate various aspects of the responses. Whether you need to check the
response structure, data types, or specific values within the responses, Otter provides a simple YAML-based
configuration for defining scenarios.
